# Introduction

    Hi, this is a tic tac toe game build using vanilla javascript,html and css. The
    rules are similar to that of the original tic tac toe game.

# Instructions

    There are some things which i want to point out. Like game only begins when you select
    the mode in which you play. It provides user vs user and user vs computer mode.
    Our AI is called Ticy. Ticy is smart hope you have fun with him. All the functionalities
    have been implemented. There are some UI clutters like a small dashed bar below the
    input bar were you can customise your marker. Note it breaks down in mobile view. So
    recommend to use it on desktop systems.

# Wanna Play

    Lets not waste anymore time and get into bussiness:
